# About TikTok Pixel | TikTok Ads Manager
## Official Documentation

---

TikTok Pixel is a piece of code that you can place on your website that allows you to share website events with TikTok. The Pixel can be used with any TikTok for Business tools to:

1. **Measure traffic** on your website
2. **Measure ad campaign performance**
3. **Optimize campaigns** and find new customers

## How It Works

Once you've successfully set up and verified the pixel on your site, it will share information on when an action is taken on your website, based on the events you've set up.

**Recommended:** Set up events that reflect a full customer journey:
- Viewing a product details page
- Adding an item to cart
- Making a purchase
