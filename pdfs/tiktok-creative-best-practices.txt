Creative is an important consideration when building high-performing ads. You don't have to be a marketing guru or video editing expert to produce ads that capture your audience's attention. The following recommendations are general best practices that have worked well for advertisers.

## 1. TikTok First

Creatives perform best when they are made for TikTok and when they leverage the power of the platform.

### Technical Basics
- ✅ Use sound/music
- ✅ Vertical orientation (9:16)
- ✅ At least 720P resolution
- ✅ Keep content within UI safe zone (see ad specifications)

### Content Guidelines
- **Feature people:** Creators, employees, or customers to capture attention and increase engagement
- **DIY aesthetic:** Go for a not overly polished style so it fits with user-generated content on TikTok
- **Lean into trends:** Make ads feel relevant and engaging. Users like when brands use trends, memes, or challenges
