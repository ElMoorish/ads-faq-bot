## Key Meta Ads 2025 Changes

### 1. Meta Is All-In on Automation (Advantage+)
Meta's Advantage+ suite is now the center of advertising ecosystem:
- AI-driven automation handles targeting, placements, creative mix, budget distribution
- Covers Shopping, App, and Lead campaigns

- Automatically allocates spend to best performers

### 2. Detailed Targeting Exclusions Removed
As of March 2025, Meta retired several detailed targeting exclusions:

- Use alongside Pixel with deduplication
- Baseline for trustworthy measurement

### 4. Updated Marketing API and Attribution Rules
- June 2025: Marketing API and Ads Insights updates
- Unified attribution models
- Affects CPA, reach, and conversion reporting

### 5. Expanding Ad Placements and Creative Formats
- New placements: Threads, Reels, Messenger
- Threads beginning to accept native ad placements
- Video-first, vertical, UGC-style creatives perform best
- Meta prioritizes immersive, native-feeling formats
