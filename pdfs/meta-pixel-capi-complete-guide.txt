## Why You Need Both Pixel + CAPI

In 2025-2026, **Pixel alone is not enough**.

- iOS 14.5+ killed third-party tracking
- Browser privacy settings block tracking scripts
- Ad blockers block the Pixel entirely
- Third-party cookies are dying

**Solution**: Meta Pixel (browser) + Conversions API (server) together.

| Feature | Meta Pixel | Conversions API |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Source | Browser | Server |
| Can be blocked | Yes | No |
| Mobile in-app browsers | Often broken | Stable |
| Deduplication | Needs setup | Server-level |
| 3rd-party checkout | Often lost | Fully tracked |

## What is Meta Pixel?

Meta Pixel is a JavaScript tracking code added to your website to capture user actions after clicking a Facebook/Instagram ad:

- Page views
- Sign-ups
- Onboarding completion
- Trial starts
- Purchases

### How Meta Pixel Works

1. User clicks on Facebook/Instagram ad
2. User lands on your page
3. Meta Pixel event fires in browser (page view, onboarding start, purchase)
4. Event sent to Meta Events Manager
5. Meta matches event to the ad and uses it for optimization

### What Meta Pixel Gives You

1. **Optimization based on business events**
   - Algorithm learns from revenue-driving actions (purchases, registrations, trials)
   - Not just clicks

2. **Full visibility into the web-stage funnel**
   - See where users drop off
   - Know which steps they complete before payment
   - Understand which creative + landing + offer combinations convert

3. **Full-funnel retargeting**
   - Re-engage users who viewed pricing
   - Target abandoned checkout
   - Reach users who started onboarding but didn't complete

4. **Audience building and scaling**
   - Build Custom Audiences from any web event
   - Create Lookalike audiences based on conversions
   - Expand to users who behave like your paying customers

5. **Linking web data to app revenue**
   - Combine with app SDK or server-side events
   - Connect web behavior to in-app subscriptions

## What is Conversions API (CAPI)?

**Conversions API (CAPI)** is server-side tracking that sends conversion events directly from your server to Meta's API.

### Why CAPI Exists

Apple's iOS 14.5 update in 2021 introduced App Tracking Transparency:
- Users could opt out of cross-app tracking
- Ad performance tanked overnight
- Browser-based measurement became unreliable

Meta's answer: Server-side tracking that:
- Respects user privacy
- Maintains ad measurement accuracy
- Bypasses browser restrictions

### What CAPI Does

- Sends events directly from your server to Meta
- Bypasses ad blockers, iOS privacy limits, browser restrictions
- Works when browser-based tracking fails
- Provides reliable conversion data

## How Pixel + CAPI Work Together

In web2app funnels:

| Stage | Tracking Method |
|-------|-----------------|
| Pre-install journey (page views, onboarding, checkout views) | Meta Pixel |
| Payments, subscription renewals | Conversions API |

**Result**: Meta receives continuous signals from first click to purchase and renewals.

This enables:
- Optimization based on revenue
- Stable algorithm learning
- Precise retargeting
- Consistent UA without data blind spots

## Meta Pixel Setup

### Step 1: Create Meta Pixel

1. Go to Meta Events Manager
2. Click **Connect data** → Select **Web**
3. Click **Connect**
4. Enter name for your pixel
5. Click **Create pixel** — Pixel ID (Dataset ID) generated
6. Save the Pixel ID

### Step 2: Install Pixel Code

**Add base code to `<head>` section of every page:**
- Place it as high in the code as possible
- Ensure it loads before other scripts

### Installation Options

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| Partner Integration | Shopify, WordPress, Wix, Squarespace |
| Manual Install | Custom websites, developers |
| Email to Developer | Teams with technical resources |

### Step 3: Configure Events

Two ways to configure:
1. **Event Setup Tool** (point-and-click in interface)
2. **Manual code installation**

During setup:
- Select existing Pixel
- Define which on-page actions to track
- Map to Meta's standard events
- Verify events in Events Manager

### Standard Events for Subscription Apps

| Event | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| ViewContent | User views product/content |
| InitiateCheckout | User starts checkout |
| CompleteRegistration | User completes sign-up |
| StartTrial | User begins trial |
| Purchase | User completes payment |

**Important**: Always prioritize standard events over custom events for UA campaigns. Custom events:
- Cannot be optimized with same efficiency
- Not used for algorithm training
- Some parameters may be ignored

## Conversions API Setup

### Step 1: Enable CAPI

1. In Meta Events Manager, enable Conversions API for selected Pixel
2. Generate CAPI Access Token
3. Use token to authorize server-to-server event delivery
4. Events appear in Events Manager as server-side

### Setup Methods

| Method | Difficulty | Best For |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Partner Integration | Easy | Shopify, WordPress, etc. |
| CAPI Gateway | Intermediate | Custom platforms, no developer |
| Custom Integration | Advanced | Custom-built sites, full control |

### Partner Integration (Recommended)

Platforms supported:
- Shopify
- WordPress (PixelYourSite plugin)
- Wix
- Squarespace

**Steps**:
1. Events Manager → Add Events → From a Partner Integration
2. Select your platform
3. Follow prompts to connect Pixel + CAPI

### CAPI Gateway (Intermediate)

Best for:
- Businesses without a developer
- Custom platforms
- Teams needing more event control

**Steps**:
1. Events Manager → Pixel → Add Events → Using Conversions API Gateway
2. Follow setup guide (runs through hosting provider)
3. Acts as bridge between server and Meta

### Custom Integration (Advanced)

For businesses with developers:
- PHP, Node.js, Python implementations
- Custom events (order value, product category)
- Full control and data fidelity

---

## Event Deduplication

**Critical**: When using both Pixel and CAPI, deduplication prevents double-counting.

Deduplication uses:
- `event_id` — unique identifier for each event
- `external_id` — user identifier

When Meta receives the same event from both sources (same `event_id`), it counts it once.

---

## Verification Checklist

### 1. Test Events

In Events Manager → Test Events:
- Open funnel in test mode
- Perform actions (page views, purchases)
- Verify events appear in Test Events panel

### 2. Check Diagnostics

Events Manager → Diagnostics tab:
- Verify Pixel is firing correctly
- Check for errors or warnings
- Monitor event match quality

### 3. Verify Server Events

Events Manager should show both:
- Browser events (from Pixel)
- Server events (from CAPI)

### 4. Monitor Event Match Quality (EMQ)

EMQ measures how well Meta can match events to users:
- Higher EMQ = better optimization
- Aim for 6.0+ score
- Improve by sending more user parameters (email, phone)
