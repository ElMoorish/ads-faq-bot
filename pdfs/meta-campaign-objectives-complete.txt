## Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong Objective = Wasted Budget**
   - Traffic objective when you want sales = algorithm finds clickers, not buyers
   
2. **Pixel Too New for Conversions**
   - Start with Traffic, build data, then switch to Conversions
   
3. **Over-Tweaking**
   - Less manual adjustment = better algorithm learning
   
4. **Generic Targeting**
   - ODAX penalizes generic objectives by deprioritizing high-value users
