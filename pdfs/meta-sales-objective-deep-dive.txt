## Overview: ODAX Framework

Meta's Outcome-Driven Ad Experiences (ODAX) reorganized campaign objectives into six core buckets:

1. **Awareness** - Reaching people most likely to remember your brand
2. **Traffic** - Sending people to a website or app
3. **Engagement** - Boosting post interactions, video views, or messages
4. **Leads** - Capturing email addresses or contact info
5. **App Promotion** - Driving app installs and usage
6. **Sales** - Getting purchases, sign-ups, or conversions

**Key Stat**: Campaigns that match objectives to the right funnel stage can see up to **2X higher conversion rates** (Meta internal data).

## Know Your Business Goals

Before running any campaign, ask: **What's the outcome I care about?**

| Goal | Best Objective |
|------|----------------|
| Brand visibility | Awareness |
| Customer acquisition & revenue | Sales |
| Mobile app growth | App Promotion |

**Common Mistake**: Choosing Traffic or Engagement thinking it will "warm up" audience—but unless algorithm is trained for conversions, you won't get desired outcomes.

## Why "Sales" Is the Best Objective for Conversions

If your goal is purchases, the **Sales objective** is the best choice.

### Why?
- Optimizes toward **real conversion events**, not vanity metrics
- Integrates with **Pixel and Conversion API** for deeper learning
- Enables **Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns** and budget automation
- Supports full-funnel targeting with dynamic creative and product catalogs

Meta has spent years fine-tuning this objective. For eCommerce, lead generation, or subscription offers, Sales should be your default.

## Setting Up a Sales Campaign: Step-by-Step

1. Start new campaign → Choose "Sales" as goal
2. Define conversion event (Purchase, Add to Cart, Lead)
3. Select budget type: Advantage+ Shopping, CBO, or ABO
4. Choose audience targeting (broad, interest, or retargeting)
5. Add creatives and placements
6. Launch and let Meta optimize toward sales outcome

**Pro Tip**: Don't skip event setup. If Meta can't track your sales actions, campaign will underperform—even with right objective.

## Event Tracking for Sales Campaigns

**Optimizing for sales starts with tracking sales.** Without proper event tracking, Meta has no feedback loop to optimize against.

### Two Main Tracking Tools

#### Meta Pixel
- Browser-based JavaScript snippet
- Tracks: PageView, AddToCart, Purchase
- Sends data to Meta in real time

#### Conversion API (CAPI)
- Server-side method of sending event data
- Works alongside Pixel
- More robust post-iOS 14

**Why Both Matter**: Combining Pixel + CAPI gives Meta complete view of customer actions—browser-side AND server-side. Results in more reliable optimization and better attribution.

## Budget Strategy for Sales Success

Your budget strategy plays a huge role in sales performance.

### Sufficient Budget Matters

**Two critical requirements**:

1. **Exit the Learning Phase**
   - Meta requires ~50 optimization events (purchases, add-to-carts) within 7-day window
   - If budget too low to generate volume → stuck in learning phase
   - Results in unstable performance and poor efficiency

2. **Compete in the Ad Auction**
   - Meta dynamically bids for impressions based on objective, targeting, budget
   - Budget too low = bids not competitive
   - Won't win high-quality impressions

### CBO vs ABO

| Feature | CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) | ABO (Ad Set Budget Optimization) |
|---------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Control | Meta distributes budget across ad sets | You set budgets per ad set |
| Best For | Scaling, broad testing | Testing specific audiences |
| Automation | High | Low |
| Flexibility | Medium | High |

**Recommendation**: Use CBO for scale, ABO for testing.

## Targeting Strategies for Sales

### Broad Targeting
- Let Meta's algorithm find your buyers
- Works well with strong creative and proper tracking
- Advantage+ uses this by default

### Interest-Based Targeting
- Layer 2-3 relevant interests
- Good for testing new audiences
- Don't over-narrow (limits reach)

### Retargeting
- Target users who visited site but didn't purchase
- Most efficient for ROAS
- Requires Pixel data and custom audiences

---

## Creative Best Practices for Sales

- **Lead with the offer** (discount, free shipping, urgency)
- **Show the product** in action
- **Use video** when possible (demonstrates value)
- **Test multiple variations** (Advantage+ does this automatically)
- **Clear CTA**: "Shop Now", "Buy Now", "Claim Offer"

---

## Key Metrics to Track for Sales Campaigns

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **ROAS** | Revenue generated per dollar spent |
| **CPA** | Cost to acquire each customer |
| **Conversion Rate** | % of clicks that convert |
| **CPM** | Cost efficiency of reach |
| **Add to Cart Rate** | Interest level in products |
| **Purchase ROAS** | True revenue efficiency |

---

## Common Sales Campaign Mistakes

1. **Wrong conversion event** - Optimizing for Add to Cart when you want Purchases
2. **Insufficient budget** - Not enough to exit learning phase
3. **Poor event tracking** - Pixel/CAPI not firing correctly
4. **Over-targeting** - Narrowing audience too much
5. **Weak creative** - Not compelling enough to drive action
6. **Ignoring attribution** - Not understanding true customer journey
